## What This Is

The Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC) was a real-time embedded computer that guided the Apollo 11 Command Module (*Columbia*, Comanche 055) and Lunar Module (*Eagle*, Luminary 099) to the Moon and back in July 1969.

This simulator faithfully emulates:

- **The AGC CPU** — 15-bit ones-complement arithmetic, ~50 opcodes, 36 fixed-memory banks, 8 erasable banks, full register set (A, L, Q, Z, EB, FB, BB)
- **The DSKY** — Display & Keyboard unit with 7-segment displays, 12 warning lights, and the full 19-key keyboard with real key codes
- **The Executive** — Priority-based cooperative task scheduler (NOVAC / FINDVAC / WAITLIST)
- **The Interpretive Language** — Double-precision scalar and vector math (DLOAD, VXSC, VXV, UNIT, SQRT, SINE, COSINE…)
- **The complete Apollo 11 mission** — 15 flight phases from Pre-Launch to Splashdown, with real GET (Ground Elapsed Time) values

## Source Code Basis

The source code in this repository (`*.s` files) is the **original 1969 AGC assembly**, digitized from MIT Museum hardcopy printouts and reassembled with [yaYUL](http://www.ibiblio.org/apollo). The simulator interprets this code at the architectural level.

| Module | File | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Comanche 055 | CM files | Command Module guidance |
| Luminary 099 | LM files | Lunar Module guidance |
| `PINBALL_GAME_BUTTONS_AND_LIGHTS.s` | 98 KB | DSKY Verb/Noun display system |
| `INTERPRETER.s` | 77 KB | Interpretive language runtime |
| `EXECUTIVE.s` | — | Task scheduler |
| `LUNAR_LANDING_GUIDANCE_EQUATIONS.s` | — | Descent targeting |
| `CONIC_SUBROUTINES.s` | 47 KB | Orbital mechanics |

### Guided Keystroke Timeline
Each flight phase includes a step-by-step guide showing:
- **What to press** — displayed as physical DSKY key sequences (e.g. `VERB` → `3` → `7` → `ENTR`)
- **Why** — the purpose of each command in context
- **Expected display** — what VERB/NOUN/PROG should show after input
- Auto-advancing steps for AGC-automatic events (no keypress needed)
- Manual "Mark Done & Next" for interactive steps

### Simulation Engine
- **Real-time accurate clock** — fractional tick accumulator ensures 1× speed = 1 real second per simulated second at any frame rate
- **Adjustable speed** — 1×, 5×, 30×, 60×, 300×, 900×
- **Sensor interpolation** — altitude, velocity, and other telemetry smoothly interpolated between mission keyframes with realistic noise
- **AGC CPU registers** — live octal display of A, L, Q, Z, EB, FB, BB, and cycle count

## Historical Context

### The 1202 Program Alarm
At T+102:33:05 during Powered Descent, the AGC triggered alarm **1202** (Executive Overflow — too many tasks queued). The guidance computer's Executive scheduler detected it was overloaded due to a rendezvous radar left powered on, stealing CPU cycles.

The AGC's design was robust enough to restart itself and recover within 1–2 seconds, discarding lower-priority tasks while preserving the critical guidance loop. Flight controller Jack Garman had pre-briefed the team that a 1202 alarm was "GO" — safe to continue.

Neil Armstrong manually overflew the planned landing site (a boulder field) using P66, touching down at 102:45:40 GET with 17 seconds of fuel remaining.

> *"Program alarm. It's a 1202."* — Buzz Aldrin
> *"We're GO on that alarm."* — Jack Garman / Steve Bales, Mission Control

This simulator replicates the 1202 alarm with the RESTART and OPR ERR lights, requiring the crew's RSET response.
